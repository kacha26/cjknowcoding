          <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
          <blockquote>
            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard
            markup language for Web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks
            of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by &lt;&gt; tags.
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Why to learn HTML</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Learning HTML can provide tremendous value to people working in
            tech, as well as to those who are running their own business or
            managing a website. Even if you just want to create an online
            portfolio for your work, HTML can be a fantastic skill to have in
            your repertoire.
          </blockquote>
          <h3>What you need before learning?</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Nothing.</strong>
            Basically, HTML is very accessible and serves as a great
            introduction for people who are new to coding. Many HTML tags are
            based on English words, so for English speakers, it’s generally easy
            to grasp the language’s concepts and syntax. So, if you have basic
            knowledge on how to use a computer, open a browser or install /
            uninstall different applications, then you are good to go.

          <h3>What is HTML5?</h3>
          <blockquote>
            HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting
            content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final major HTML
            version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
            The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It
            is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
            Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple,
            Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).
          </blockquote>
          <h3>How to learn HTML?</h3>

            <em> <strong>Practice..</strong> </em>You can get all the
            information you need on this very web site. But, to learn HTML, you
