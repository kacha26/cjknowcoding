                Projects can initiate operations and viceversa. Lets consider
                construction of a manufacturing plant. It is a project and the
                end result is a unique manufacturing plant that is used to
                manufacture different products. The manufacture of products
                involve operations. Thus project has lead to operations. Now,
                for instance, if the sale of the manufactured product is low,
                then to increase sales, online presence is required. Then a new
                project will be initiated to deliver a website to take orders
                online. Thus operations have lead to initiation of a project.

        <h3>Risk, Issue, Assumption and Constraint:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Risk</strong> is an uncertain event or condition. It can be
          either positive (oppurtunity) or negative (threat). The risks are
          identified, analysed and documented in Risk register and responded
          accordingly. Risk can be a pure risk like an employee loosing a limb
          or business risk like techinical failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Issues</strong> are the risk events that have occured. Every
          issue is logged in issue log and has a specific owner and resolution
          date.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumptions</strong> are some of the aspects that are believed
          to be true but not proven to be true. Assumption can also be a risk.
          Examples are stake holder support, availability of resources etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Constraint</strong> can be anything that limits the options
          like budget, resources, vendors, requirements etc.

          <strong>Scope</strong> defines the boundaries of a project, and

          description of objectives, deliverables and requirements.

        The content present on this site is more like my personal notes that I
        have prepared for CAPM certification exam. Since I have prepare from the
        mentioned course, most of the content would be similar in presentation.
        So, I acknowledge the original creator to be Mr. Joseph Phillips and I'm
        only a student of his.
