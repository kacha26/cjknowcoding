        The content present on this site is more like my personal notes that I
        have prepared for CAPM certification exam. Since I have prepare from the
        mentioned course, most of the content would be similar in presentation.
        So, I acknowledge the original creator to be Mr. Joseph Phillips and I'm
        only a student of his.
