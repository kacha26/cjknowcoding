          <li>
            <strong>Users: </strong>Employees and customers that use IT services
          </li>

            <h3>Incident management:</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Incident:</strong> An incident is considered to be any
              event that could lead to a unplanned interruption of IT services
              or reduction in quality for the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objective of incident management is to restore a normal
              service of operation (in accordance with SLA) as soon as possible
              and to minimize the impact on the business operations. Thus
              ensuring the best possible levels of service quality and
              availability are maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Major Incident Management: </strong> It is an incident
              that results in significant disruption to the business and demands
              a response beyond the routine incident management process. Major
              incidents have a seperate procedure with smaller timescales and
              urgency that is required to accelerate the resolution process for
              incidents with high business impact. It is an incident with high
              priority that impacts multiple users, fincancial departments,
              critical systems, production plans etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Incident life cycle:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                End user will report in an incident through email/chat/call.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help desk raises the incident in ITSM tool based on the end
                user's input.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help desk captures the crucial information related to the
                incident such as impact, urgency and location.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help desk will search for appropriate knowledge article (KA) and
                assign the incident to the relevant assignment group.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assignee will trouble shoot the incident by following the KA.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once addressed, the assignee, will change the state of the
                incident to resolved and fill in the resolution notes.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the end user does not confirm the resolution, he can reopen
                and the flow moves to step 5. If end user doesn't respond, the
                incident will be automatically closed in a predefined timeframe.
              </li>
              <p>
                <em>Note: </em>Incidents in resolved state can be reopened but
                not the incidents in closed state.
              </p>
            </ol>
            <h4>Major incident life cycle:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                End user will report the incident through email/chat/call.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help desk raises the incident in ITSM tool based on the end user
                input.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help desk realises it is an major incident (MI) and reports to
                Major Incident Manager (MIM).
              </li>
              <li>
                MIM realises it is not suitable for MI and follow regular IM
                process. If found suitable, the MIM will raise the priority and
                assign the MI to the appropriate group.
              </li>
              <li>
                Post assignment, the MIM will send out communication to both
                internal and to the customers and if needed he will create a
                bridge call with the teams that are working on the MI.
              </li>
              <li>
                The MIM will constantly follow up with the involved teams and
                keep the stakeholders informaed through out the MI life cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Post resolution confirmation, the MI will be marked as resolved.
                It will be reported to problem manager to perform root cause
                analysis (RCA) to contribute to CSI initiative.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Request fulfillment:</h3>
            <p>
              The <em>Request fulfillment</em> is the process responcible for
              managing the life cycle of all service requests from the users.
              These service requests can vary from an access, a new laptop or a
              software installation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all organizations have this process in place, however, if
              number of service requests is a large one, it would be smart to
              handle service requests as a seperate work stream. Examples:
              password reset, access to a shared folder, installing an
              unauthorised software etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Request fulfillment life cycle:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                End user initiates the service request via service now
                <ul>
                  <li>The main ticket itself is called a <em>request</em></li>
                  <li>
                    What the user is asking for is called a
                    <em>requested item</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What the agents and suppliers are doing to fulfill the
                    request are called <em>tasks</em>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Depending on whether the request need any approval or not, it
                moved to 3rd or 4th step
              </li>
              <li>Approvers approves the request</li>
              <li>Transverse team checks stock</li>
              <li>
                Transverse team orders and awaits the delivery of the product
              </li>
              <li>Transverse team configures the requested item</li>
              <li>
                Transverse team delivers the requested item and moves the state
                to completed / closed

            <h3>Problem management:</h3>
            <p>
              A <em>Problem</em> is an unknown root cause of one or more
              existing and potential incidents. Problems may sometimes be
              identified because of multiple incidents that exhibit common
              symptoms
            </p>
            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Minimize the adverse impact of the incidents and problems on the
                business, that is caused by errors within services and
                technology
              </li>
              <li>
                Prevent the recurrence of incidents releated to same error
                through RCA of the incidents and initiate actions to correct or
                improve the situation
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Objectives:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Discover and remove errors from the infrastructure</li>
              <li>
                To assure delivery of highest possible level of stability in IT
                services by finding and eliminating errors
              </li>
              <li>Gather information through RCA and</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Process type:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Proactive: </strong>Identifying and solving problems and
                known errors before the incident occurs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reactive:</strong> Solving problems in response to one
                or more incidents.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Problem management life cycle:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Probem <em>Trigger</em>: The problem trigger can happen either
                by service desk or incident manager identifying the problem or a
                problem manager / automated process proactively finding out the
                problem before the incident occurs. The supplier can also inform
                the problem manager upfront that a potential error can exist
                with the provided hardware or software.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a work around is already in place, then the problem manager
                refers to the known errors in DB, apply it and then close the
                problem. If there is no work around, then first the problem
                manager will assess the priority and category.
              </li>
              <li>
                Problem manager then conducts RCA and discovers what lead to the
                recurrence of the incidents and the primary source of the
                problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                Problem manager applies the fix and other process managers
                support problem manager since its primarily the problem
                manager's responcibility.
              </li>
              <li>Problem manager marks the problem as resolved.</li>
              <li>
                Post confirmation, the problem manager closes the problem.

            <h4>Goal:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Change management is the process responcible for controlling the
                life cycle of all changes and works to enable beneficial changes
                to be made with minimal disruption to IT services.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Objective:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The objective of change management is to ensure that the changes
                are recorded, assessed, authorized, prioritized, planned,
                tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a controlled
                manner.
              </li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Normal</strong>: Requires approval from a predefined
                persona or Change advisory board (CAB).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Standard</strong>: Requires no approval and are the most
                common changes that an organisation can deal with.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Emergency</strong>: Unplanned and require authorisation
                from CAB.
              </li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Change request is identified. The <em>Trigger</em> can be from
                request fulfilment, incident management, problem management or
                event management, where there exists a need for change in the IT
                services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Request for change (RFC) is raised by change manager. The change
                manager should ask the seven Rs:
                <ol>
                  <li>Who <em>Raised</em> the request?</li>
                  <li>What is the <em>Reason</em> behind the change?</li>
                  <li>
                    What is the expected <em>Return</em> required from the
                    change?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What are the <em>Risks</em> involved in the requested

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Who is <em>responcible</em> to create, test and implement
                    the change phases?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How many <em>Resources </em>are required to deliver the
                    change?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What is the <em>Relation </em>between suggested change and
                    other changes.

                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                Change request is assessed by change manager, depending on the
                priority, category, sub-category etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the change is a normal or emergency one, then autherisation
                for change authority or CAB is required or else it is skipped
                and the change manager then sceduled the change. (Since the
                change impacts the IT services, the change manager should
                consider the timeframe so as to have least impact on IT
                services.)
              </li>
              <li>The involved team will implement the change.</li>
              <li>
                The implemented change is reviewed to determine if the
                implementation is successful.
              </li>
              <li>
                Close the process. (Or cancel if the change is no longer

        The content present on this site is more like my personal notes that I
        have prepared for CAPM certification exam. Since I have prepare from the
        mentioned course, most of the content would be similar in presentation.
        So, I acknowledge the original creator to be Mr. Joseph Phillips and I'm
        only a student of his.
