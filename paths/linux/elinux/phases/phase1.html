      <h3>The journey:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Customizing the desktop:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After rebooting, to change the look and feel, first download some
              wallpapers (firefox browser is installed by default) and change
              the existing wallpapers for all the workspaces. Here different
              wallpapers can be set for different workspaces.
            </li>
            <li>Explore settings manager and change the appearance</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Keyboard shortcuts:</h4>
          <p>
            The approach we have for linux is much more different from the
            regular windows usage. We will focus more on using keyboard for all
            the actions and completely eleminate mouse actions. For this, we
            have to bind keyboard shortcuts.
          </p>
          <p>The main actions when working with linux include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Opening different windows:</strong>
              When multiple windows are open we can tile the windows on
              different parts of the screen. This can be done in windows manager
              - keyboard tab. As example, use ctrl + arrow keys to tile window
              into half in respective directions, use ctrl + super + arrows to
              tile in four quadrants. super + a to maximize, super + q to close
              windows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Working with different workspaces: </strong>When we work
              with multiple windows, it will be a good idea to group related
              windows into a workspace. Now set keyboard shortcuts to change
              work spaces. Its better to keep it simple as we change workspaces
              very often. Example - super + arrows for changing workspaces and
              super + 1,2,3.... for changing to a specific workspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Moving windows between workspaces: </strong>To move the
              windows between workspaces, it would be a good idea to just add
              shift key to shortcuts used for changing workspaces. Example -
              super + shift + arrows / 1,2,3....
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>You can also bind shortcuts for applications
            like terminal, browser etc., but we recommend not to do that yet.
            Just practice tiling the windows at different positions, changing
            different workspaces and moving windows between workspaces using the
            keyboard shortcuts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Using terminal:</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Before we get into using terminal, we strongly recommend to practice
            the concepts in section 1 atleast once. You should use terminal with
            confidence. It would save a hell a lot of time going forward.
            Searching for information is good but if you keep looking for
            information that you have already learnt but forgot, then you will
            only be running in circles. So, please practice all the previously
            learnt concepts before you move forward.
