      <h3>The journey:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Customizing the desktop:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After rebooting, to change the look and feel, first download some
              wallpapers (firefox browser is installed by default) and change
              the existing wallpapers for all the workspaces. Here different
              wallpapers can be set for different workspaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explore settings manager and change the appearance. In session and
              start up - Application auto start, disable variety. If not
              disabled, it will reset the display resolution and wallpapers to
              default on next restart.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Keyboard shortcuts:</h4>
          <p>
            The approach we have for linux is much more different from the
            regular windows usage. We will focus more on using keyboard for all
            the actions and completely eleminate mouse actions. For this, we
            have to bind keyboard shortcuts.
          </p>
          <p>The main actions when working with linux include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Opening different windows:</strong>
              When multiple windows are open we can tile the windows on
              different parts of the screen. This can be done in windows manager
              - keyboard tab. As example, use ctrl + arrow keys to tile window
              into half in respective directions, use ctrl + super + arrows to
              tile in four quadrants. super + a to maximize, super + q to close
              windows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Working with different workspaces: </strong>When we work
              with multiple windows, it will be a good idea to group related
              windows into a workspace. Now set keyboard shortcuts to change
              work spaces. Its better to keep it simple as we change workspaces
              very often. Example - super + arrows for changing workspaces and
              super + 1,2,3.... for changing to a specific workspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Moving windows between workspaces: </strong>To move the
              windows between workspaces, it would be a good idea to just add
              shift key to shortcuts used for changing workspaces. Example -
              super + shift + arrows / 1,2,3....
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>You can also bind shortcuts for applications
            like terminal, browser etc., but we recommend not to do that yet.
            Just practice tiling the windows at different positions, changing
            different workspaces and moving windows between workspaces using the
            keyboard shortcuts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Using terminal:</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Before we get into using terminal, we strongly recommend to practice
            the concepts in section 1 atleast once. You should use terminal with
            confidence. It would save a hell a lot of time going forward.
            Searching for information is good but if you keep looking for
            information that you have already learnt but forgot, then you will
            only be running in circles. So, please practice all the previously
            learnt concepts before you move forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now lets customize the terminal. Customizing in linux is done
            through the configuration files located in .config/app folder. For
            Alacritty, its ~/.config/alacritty. Edit alacritty.yml file and set
            the font etc, to your liking. The options to set in .yml file are
            well explained using comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explore all the other directories in .config, especially the
            autostart directory. At this point, we have the desktop completely
            configured for your liking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Maintaining ur system:</h4>
          <p>
            Now lets make your system function to your liking. For this you need
            to know how to install, remove and update different applications on
            your system. These applications are available individulally and in
            groups, called Packages. These packages are mantained by a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager"
              >Package manager</a
            >. For Arch, its <a href="https://archlinux.org/pacman/">Pacman</a>.
            Pacman keeps the system up-to-date by synchronizing package lists
            with the master server. This server/client model also allows the
            user to download/install packages with a simple command, complete
            with all required dependencies. Pacman provides a
            <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman"
              >wide variety of commands</a
            >. Lets see the frequently used commands:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Install:</strong></li>
            <code>pacman -S <em>PackageName</em></code>
            <li><strong>Remove:</strong></li>
            <code>pacman -R <em>PackageName</em></code>
            <li><strong>Update</strong></li>
            <code>pacman -Syu</code>
            <li><strong>Search for an installed package</strong></li>
            <code>pacman -Qs <em>PackageName</em></code>
            <li><strong>Search for package in database</strong></li>
            <code>pacman -Ss <em>string1 string2 ...</em></code>
          </ul>
          <p>Now lets install some packages. Fish, exa and rofi.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fish:</strong> Fish shell is a shell just like bash shell.
              Install fish shell and make it default shell.
              <code>chsh -s /bin/fish</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exa</strong> Application that gives color to output of ls
              command. Instead of ls, exa command should be used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rofi:</strong> Rofi is an application that can open
              different applications installed and also change between the
              windows. Create shortcuts for using rofi. super + space to open
              rofi, alt + 1 to change window
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Install any other applications that you need like vscode or browsers
            or anything else. At this point you can completely ditch the mouse.
            Keep practicing the keyboard shortcuts and you will realise that it
            is much faster and simpler to use keyboard than it looks. From now
            on, just not to touch mouse for anything. It will take time and its
            worth the effort.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Aliases:</h4>
          <p>
            An alias replaces a string that invokes a command in the Linux shell
            with another user-defined string. Aliases are mostly used to replace
            long commands, improving efficiency and avoiding potential spelling
            errors. For example, lets conside our exa command. We can create an
            alias lsa using the following command
          </p>
          <code
            >alias -s lsa='exa -abFghHiMnlS@ --git --git-repos
            --group-directories-first'</code
          >
          <p>
            In the above format, you can save any command as an alias an use it
            late. Because we have a fish shell now, alias are save using -s
            option. But if it is bash or zsh, then we have to add the alias to
            the .bashrc or .zshrc files. Zsh is an alternate shell with loads of
            customizations available. Fish shell comes with all the useful
            features out of the box. We recommend fish, and it is also a good
            idea to explore zsh and oh my zsh if you have time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Before moving on any further, shutdown your
            VM (this is your base VM from now,) and create a clone. You have all
            the setup you need for work ready. So, just keep the VM that way and
            create a clone. Going forward work on the clone. If you mess
            everything up, ditch the clone and create a new clone from the base
            VM.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Skel:</h4>
          <p>
            The /etc/skel folder is the skeleton of the directories that will be
            created when new users are added. You can cd to /etc/skel and check
            the contents. Now su root and then create new user, u1. Now check
            the contents of /home/u1. The content of /home/u1 will be the same
            as /etc/skel. Now cd /etc and rm -r skel or cp to take back up. No
            cp your home directory as /etc/skel.
          </p>
          <code>cp -r /home/yourusername /etc/skel</code>
          <p>
            Now every new user you create will have the same setting as your
            base VM. Going forward, if you want to retain content of your main
            user to new user, then sync the /etc/skel folder again with your
            main user directory.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For the next 30 days, use this VM as your daily work machine and try to
        completely ditch the mouse. The more you work, the more problems you get
        into, the more solutions you will find and the more knowledge you gain.
        Poke around anything and everything. If you completely messup, ditch the
        work VM, clone another work VM from the base VM. It is a good idea to
        use git and git hub to save your work or any specific files. Just clone
        VM and then repository from git hub. Now it is all about knowing whats
        happening with your machine. Observe and learn. We will see you in
