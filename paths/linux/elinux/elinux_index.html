    <h2>What's in this section?</h2>
    <p>
      With the knowledge in the previous section, you can choose any distro and
      get started. At this point, we would strongly recommend using virtual
      machines. Using linux everyday is like starting a life in an unknown city.
      The learning curve is very steep. There will be many instaces when you
      mess things up. In such situations, virtual machines will be very handy.
      You can just clone another working VM and start again.

      All the information in this section will make you an expert in
      <a
        href="https://www.archlinux.org"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Arch Linux</a
      >. Most of the information will be common for other distro like ubuntu but
      the main focus is Arch. This can be applied to any distro that is based on
      Arch linux. We strongly agree to the point that
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch wiki</a> is
      <strong><em>The most</em></strong> reliable and authentic source of
      information, and this section will only refer to the wiki many times.
      Consider this section as journey of a user shifting from other OS to
      linux. If you dont have a favourite distro already, we would recommend to
      check out
      <a
        href="https://www.arcolinux.info"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Arcolinux</a
      >. This is so far our favourite distro. In this section, we will go
      through different learning phases of Arcolinux by installing different
      distros and step by step learn using linux like a pro.
