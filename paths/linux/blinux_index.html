                <h3>What is linux?</h3>
                <p>To understand what is linux, one should be familiar with the following points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Operating System<em>
                                The OS</em>
                        </strong>: An operating system is a collection of software that can manage hardware resources and provide an environment for applications to run.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The linux kernel</strong>: A kernel is an intermediary between the hardware and the software.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distro</strong>: A linux kernel combined with other software becomes the full on operation system which is called a linux distribution or simply
                        <em>
                            Distro.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>: The additional software that is required for the linux kernel to be a full fledged operating system is provided by the GNU project. Hence, GNU/Linux is the original operating system. And the distrubutions are the implementations or the different flavours of GNU/Linux each one with their own goals and focus of interests.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are hundreds of linux distros which are curated softwares of GNU/Linux. You can use any distro to practice the concepts in this Tutorials. My personal favourite is

                <h3>Kernel, Shell, Bash, terminal and prompt:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
                        Kernel is a computer program that forms the core of an opereating system that performs tasks like managing hardware and memory, scheduling tasks etc.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shell:</strong>
                        Shell is the default interface to the linux system. Shell exposes the OS's services to human users or other programs / applications. Shell takes the human commands and give them to OS to perform. It is the outer layer of the Kernel / OS, hence the name
                        <em>"Shell"</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bash:</strong>
                        Bash is the most popular shell program. Bash runs pretty much on any linux distro.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Terminal:</strong>
                        Terminal is a program that runs shell. Humans interact with shell. Shell the runs shell. Shell inturn gives commands to OS. And the OS performs the task requested by the human.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prompt:</strong>
                        Prompt is the basic information that is provided to the user, when shell is opened. It prompts the user to enter an input.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Normal users and Super users:</h3>
                <p>A Super user has full control over the OS and can perform any action.</p>

            <h3>I have learnt Linux from
                <em>Mr. Colt steele</em>
                through his awesome course on Udemy - The linux command line bootcamp: Beginner to power user.</h3>
            <p>As the course's title emphasises, the course helps the learner to understand the basics and apply the knowledge using GNU/Linux as their everyday operating system. In this Tutorials, I'm only including the basic concepts and the course has much more than the content presented in this Tutorials.</p>
            <p>This Tutorials is just a personal practice but still have the content necessary for readers to get started with GNU/Linux.</p>
